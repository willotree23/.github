## Description

This study aimed to test whether free-ranging animals would choose to cooperate with partners to achieve a greater payoff in a cooperative task under natural conditions. Wild Guinea baboons were presented with paired boxes that yielded food only if both levers were pulled simultaneously, and the baboons could freely choose between potential partners that varied in their ability to extract food rewards from the boxes. However, the study was terminated, because the baboons behaved too aggressively against the researchers after the first test trials.

## Dependencies

### Hardware

The provided drawing was created in [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/), which has a sufficient free version for personal use, a full version can also be obtained free of charge for education and research purposes.
Alternatively the repository also includes exports of the drawings as STEP- and STL-Files for you to import in you preferred CAD software or 3D-Printing directly.

### Firmware

The Firmware was developed using the awesome [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/).
For convenience the repository also includes scripts that set up a temporary light version of PlatformIO automatically and flash your microcontroller without any installation steps required.
