## Description

This study aimed to test whether free-ranging animals would choose to cooperate with partners to achieve a greater payoff in a cooperative task under natural conditions. Wild Guinea baboons were presented with paired boxes that yielded food only if both levers were pulled simultaneously, and the baboons could freely choose between potential partners that varied in their ability to extract food rewards from the boxes. However, the study was terminated, because the baboons behaved too aggressively against the researchers after the first test trials.

## Abstract

Choosing the right partners can mean the difference between success or failure at a cooperative task. Several studies in captivity have explored the extent to which animals can identify characteristics that make individuals better or worse at completing a joint task and whether animals use such information when choosing partners, with mixed evidence. Our study set out to test if free-ranging animals chose to cooperate with partners that provided a greater payoff in a cooperative task under natural conditions. We presented wild Guinea baboons (Papio papio) with paired boxes that yielded food only if operated simultaneously. The baboons could freely choose between potential partners that varied in their ability to extract food rewards from the boxes. During test trials, the baboons repeatedly solved the two-box task, though in a manner that suggests they failed to grasp the partner's role. Instead of varied partner choice, two males each monopolized access to one set of paired boxes and pulled with whichever partners sat next to them. Monopolization of the boxes did not extend to the food reward, which males allowed juveniles, females, and other males to feed on. Unfortunately, we were forced to terminate our study after only three days because the baboons behaved too aggressively toward researchers after test trials. Though we were unsuccessful in running our study to completion, our experiences can be useful for those planning cooperative field experiments in the future.

## Dependencies

### Hardware

The provided drawing was created in [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/), which has a sufficient free version for personal use, a full version can also be obtained free of charge for education and research purposes.
Alternatively the repository also includes exports of the drawings as STEP- and STL-Files for you to import in you preferred CAD software or 3D-Printing directly.

### Firmware

The Firmware was developed using the awesome [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/).
For convenience the repository also includes scripts that set up a temporary light version of PlatformIO automatically and flash your microcontroller without any installation steps required.
